As a user, I want the recommended songs to be based on my preferred artists and genres, as well as the current weather conditions.

Narrative:
- The user opens the app and is directed to the 'log-in' or 'sign-up' page if not already logged in.
- If new user, is then displayed text asking for authorization to access the user's Spotify profile.
- If accepted, the user is then directed to the home page.
- The home page displays recommended songs and playlists based on the data collected using Spotify's API.
